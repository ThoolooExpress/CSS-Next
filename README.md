This is the source repo for the Fordham University Computer Science Society's
homepage, hosted at [beta.fordhamcss.org](http://beta.fordhamcss.org).

This readme is divided into two sections.  The first, "Content Management" is
aimed at anybody who is adding or editing the content, but not the design of
the site.  The second, "Design and Maintenance", describes the specifics of
how the site was created, and best practices for changing the design.
