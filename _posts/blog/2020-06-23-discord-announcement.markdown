Hello Everyone!

Did you know the Fordham Computer Science Society is now on Discord??? We really enjoy seeing your smiling faces at our events, but only hearing from you once every two weeks isn't enough! 

The CSS discord is a place for current students, as well as alumni to come and talk about anything they would like. We hope to have students share advice on which classes to take, how to make yourself a better programmer, questions with homework or personal projects, or just talk and share some memes. 

Are you an alumni looking for employees? The CSS discord is a great place to network with Fordham Students. Are you a student looking for an internship? Maybe you can find some resources here. 

We would like club members to be involved in the club well beyond their four years as a Fordham ram, and our discord is a great, informal way to keep in touch!
