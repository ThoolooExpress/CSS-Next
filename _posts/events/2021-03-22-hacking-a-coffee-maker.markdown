Hey Hackers! Did you ever think that it would be a good idea to take a seemingly simple thing; coffee makers, and connect them to the internet? No? Good, cause we didn't either. Come to our "Hacking a Coffee Maker" event where we'll test the security of "smart" WiFi enabled coffee makers. You'll get an introduction to embedded systems, and compete with your peers to see who can master the art of exploiting java**

There will be pizza!

There is some software you'll need to download for this event; [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/#download), [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [nmap](https://nmap.org/download.html). It would make things super easy if you could install it before you come (although if you can't figure it out, don't sweat, we can help you when you're here). Note for Windows people, when you're installing Python, if you don't already have it, make sure you choose the option that says something like "Add to PATH" while you're installing (It will save everyone some headaches).
