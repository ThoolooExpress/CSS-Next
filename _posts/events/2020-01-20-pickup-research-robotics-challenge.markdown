Welcome back from break! To kick off this semester's research, we'll be having a
fun and informative robotics challenge, to get everybody in the swing of working
with the hardware we have.  You'll be split up into groups, and challenged with
completing simple, fun tasks with the robotics kits we have in our inventory.
The idea of this challenge is to let you guys figure out how to use the kits
from the documentation provided, so no previous robotics or programming
experience is required.  The best team will win cool prizes (TBD, but think
Tee-Shirts or hardware!)  Snacks will be provided for all teams!

Please (RSVP)[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMej2iOe9Ke0haRGdFoe1J-XnPILRgt-wTFVORPArNxO5VhA/viewform?usp=sf_link],
and add the Google Calendar event so you can be reminded.

The event will be held at 5:30PM, on Wednesday, January 22, in Duane 352 (The one with the balcony!!)

Just to say it again, *no previous experience required*.  The robotics kits used in this event should be
new to all participants, so freshman have just as good a chance of winning as seniors.
