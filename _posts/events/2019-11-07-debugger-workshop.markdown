No matter what level you are in CS, debugging only going to get harder as you start working on more complex programs and learning new skills.  If you're still printing variables to the terminal to see what's actually going on... you need this.  In place of an interview prep session this week, we're doing a practical workshop on how to use a debugger to pause your programs mid execution, set and read variable values, and generally understand what your computer is _really_ doing.
