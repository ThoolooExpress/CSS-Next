Welcome to the Fordham Computer Science Society! We're going to be holding our annual kickoff meeting on **Monday, September 14, 2020 at 7:00 PM.** We're extremely excited for this semester and have some really cool events planned. Our first meeting will be on Zoom, but we are hoping to have some in person events this semester as well. The club is open to all students that are interested in Computer Science, not just CS majors. 

Come join us on Monday to network with your fellow students and learn about our plans for the semester!
