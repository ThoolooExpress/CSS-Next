Welcome to the Fordham Computer Science Society, we can't wait to get started with this semester!

Come join us for our fall 2020 kickoff meeting where you'll be able to learn about our club, network with your fellow computer science students, and maybe win a prize. Our first meeting will be on Zoom, but we are hoping to have some in person events this semester as well. The club is open to all students, not just CS majors! Details below:
