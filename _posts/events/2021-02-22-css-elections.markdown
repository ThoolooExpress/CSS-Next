Put on your voting shoes! It's time for Eboard Elections!
 
If you came to our first meeting of the semester, aka Kickoff, or if you've read the past few emails, then you know it's election time! Unfortunately since we can't meet in person we are postponing the LED ball event and having elections tomorrow instead. So shout out to all of our wonderful candidates who interviewed, it's finally time to give your speech!

Join us tomorrow as we hear speeches from each of our candidates and make your voice heard by voting for next year's executive board! 
 
Date: Monday, February 22
Time: 7:00PM
Location: Zoom
