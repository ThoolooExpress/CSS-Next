Hi everybody, I&#39;m your treasurer for the 2020-2021 academic year. I&#39;m a senior majoring in economics, with a minor in computer science. I&#39;m experienced in R, C++ and a range of more business-oriented programs such as Visio and Excel. My internship experience has consisted of work in various finance functions. If you ever need any help with these programs or economics just ask me, I&#39;m always happy to help.
